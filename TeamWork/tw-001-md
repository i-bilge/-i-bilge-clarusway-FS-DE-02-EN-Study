4. Describe floats and how they work
The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).
5. What is Inline style?
Inline styles are styles that are applied to a specific element within the body section of the webpage. The style will be applied to that individual element only rather than to the entire page (internal style) or across all linked pages (external style sheet).
